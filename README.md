## General Information
> Problem: Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. 

> Goal: Identify risky loan applicants early thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Conduct analysis to understand the driving factors behind loan default - variables which are strong indicators of default. Customer shall then utilize this knowledge for its ongoing portfolio and risk assessment.

## Conclusions
- Analysis: Default risk of loans with income not verified is much higher for amounts over 6K and 3P income verified loans over 8K.
- Proposal: Mandate an income verification process by the lender for loans over 6K
- Analysis: Short term loans with higher interest rate (> 10%) are at risk of defaults.
- Analysis: Sub grades B3, B4, B5, C3, D2, D3& D4 are most at risk of defaults and annual incomes below 40K will need extra scrutiny.
- Proposal: Mandate an Annual Income > 40K as eligibility for all the loans
- Most at risk: Early career (2 to 5 years) member with incomes not verified
- Next most at risk: Freshers (<=1 year) with incomes not verified 
- Proposal: Mandate income verification process for loan applicants up to 5 years of employment experience particularly for loan grades B, C and D
